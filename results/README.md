Placeholder artifacts
====================

Due to repository size limits, trained model binaries are provided as lightweight placeholders. Regenerate them locally with:

```
python -m src.run_all
```

This will overwrite the placeholder `.joblib` files with the actual trained models and populate metrics/plots in this folder.
