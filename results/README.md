Results contents
================

This folder stores metrics and diagnostic plots generated by the pipeline. The tracked files match the outputs produced by
running:

```
python -m src.run_all
```

Key artifacts include the parity and residual plots, along with CSV/JSON metrics files. Model binaries (`*.joblib`) and PNG
figures are generated locally when you run the command above but are ignored by Git to avoid committing binary blobs. After
running, you will find the four parity/residual PNGs in this folder for review.

Feel free to rerun the command above to regenerate or update the outputs from the dataset in `data/`.
